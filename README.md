## Lab 0: Scavenger Hunt!

In this lab, we will gain experience with a UNIX terminal, which (among other things) provides us with a way to navigate and manipulate the files on a computer’s hard drive.

Commands you’ll learn:
- `cat`
- `cd`
- `cp`
- `head`
- `less`
- `ls`
- `mkdir`
- `mv`
- `pwd`
- `rm`
- `tail`
- `unzip`
- `>` (output redirection)
